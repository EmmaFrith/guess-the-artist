# Guess the artist

## Background


Play 'Guess the artist' to test your art knowledge. 

I built this quiz as I enjoy art and identifying art based on its style.

The game features 10 paintings, each with 4 multiple choice answers. After selecting your choice you'll be told whether or not you were correct. Your score will go up by one with each correct answer. 

At the end of the game you'll recieve a personalised message based on how many answers you got correct.

## Future enhancements

This MVP can be enhanced by adding more paintings and randomising the paintings shown each time you play. 

It could also feature more themes, such as 'Guess the movemenent'.
